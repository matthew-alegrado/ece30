Responsibility: Implementing the Shannon-Fano encoding algorithm functions in assembly language.
Tasks:
    Implement the FindTail function.
    Implement the FindMidpoint function.
    Implement the Partition function.
    Implement the IsContain function.
    Implement the Encode function.
Test each function independently to ensure correctness.
Additional Comments:
Ensure each function follows the provided pseudo-code closely.
Use appropriate comments to explain the purpose of each instruction and each block of code.
Test thoroughly to ensure each function works as expected before moving on to the next one.




Team Member 2:
Responsibility: Implementing the main function and conducting extensive testing.
Tasks:
Implement the main function to orchestrate the encoding process using the Shannon-Fano tree.
Load the symbol array and text array from data files.
Conduct extensive testing to verify the correctness and robustness of the implemented functions.
Test the behavior of each function independently and in conjunction with others.
Debug any issues encountered during testing and ensure the program terminates correctly.
Additional Comments:
Pay close attention to memory management and ensure proper handling of symbol arrays and tree structures.
Document the main function clearly, including how it interacts with other functions and data structures.
Provide detailed test cases and verify that the program behaves correctly under various scenarios.
